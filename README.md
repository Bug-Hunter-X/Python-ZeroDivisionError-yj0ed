This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a common runtime error: ZeroDivisionError. The program defines a function that divides two numbers, but it does not handle the case where the denominator is zero. When the function is called with a denominator of zero, it raises a ZeroDivisionError. The solution demonstrates how to handle this error using a try-except block.
